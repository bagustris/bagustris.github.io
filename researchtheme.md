The following is research theme that I offered, particularly for Enginenering Physics students ITS.  
*Berikut ini adalah judul-judul TA yang saya tawarkan kepada mahasiswa, khususnya mahasiswa Departemen Teknik Fisika ITS.*    

For undergraduate level, I will provide the baseline method, and you will improve the results using the proposed method.

Undergraduate/bachelor level:  
1. Speech emotion recognition using multilayer perceptron with CCC loss, dataset: IEMOCAP
2. Indonesian speech recognition using DeepSpeech/STT
3. Toward universal acousctic features for multi-corpus speech emotion recognition
4. Predicting Alzheimer desease using speech analysis 

Master level:  
1. Abnormal sound detection for predictive maitenance (the method is from you/your idea), dataset: DCASE


Other topics/themes:  
Read my [papers](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=xuiLAewAAAAJ&hl=en). Usually, I write down the remaining task for future work in that paper. 
For master level, you can also propose your research theme. Contact me by email for details.

## Research Theme
The following is research theme that I offered, particularly for Enginenering Physics students ITS.  
*Berikut ini adalah tema riset, khususnya judul-judul TA yang saya tawarkan kepada mahasiswa Departemen Teknik Fisika ITS.*    

For undergraduate level, I will try to provide the baseline method, and you will improve the results using the proposed method.
 
1. Speech emotion recognition using multilayer perceptron with CCC loss, dataset: IEMOCAP
2. Indonesian speech recognition using Wav2Vec2/Hubert/WavLM/UniSpeech-SAT, etc.
3. Toward universal acoustic features for multi-corpus speech emotion recognition, 30+ datasets.  
~~4. Predicting Alzheimer desease using speech analysis.~~
5. Development of Calfem-Python
6. Development of Vibration Toolbox  
~~7. Abnormal sound detection for predictive maitenance (the method is from you/your idea), dataset: DCASE~~
8. Indonesian emotional Speech synthesis Using FastSpeech  
~~9. COVID-19 diagnosis using COUGH sound with deep learning~~
10. COVID-19 diagnosis using SPEECH sound with deep learning, dataset: ComPare CSS 2021
11. Predicting Pathological voice disorder with speech processing technique, dataset: SVD, Voiced, HUPA

## Other topics/themes:  
Read my [papers](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=xuiLAewAAAAJ&hl=en). Usually, I wrote down the remaining tasks for future work in that topic. 
For master level, you can also propose your research theme. Contact me by email for details.

## Typical Timeline:  
![Timeline for undergraduate](images/pengerjaan-ta.png)

The timeline is ideal for undergraduate (S1), it can be adapted for master (S2) and PhD (three years of research from the beginning).

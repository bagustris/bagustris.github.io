## Research Theme

My research goals aimed at extracting knowledge from acoustic information (aka acoustic features). The examples of this theme are: speech emotion recognition, abnormal sound detection, and audio classication. Moreover, the research can be extended to vibration signal. My approaches to achieve these goal are defined by: (1) data-drive approach (instead of physical modeling), (2) focus on practical implemention (not necessary to follow human  mechanism), and robustness (how stable the model given any perturbation instead of correctness). For me, science should be evidence-based, able to be implemented and consistent. My reserach contributes to developing technologies to solve issues in Society 5.0 (What is Society 5.0?

The following is research theme that I offered, particularly for Enginenering Physics students ITS.  
*Berikut ini adalah tema riset, khususnya judul-judul TA yang saya tawarkan kepada mahasiswa Departemen Teknik Fisika ITS.*    

For undergraduate level, I will try to provide the baseline method, and you will improve the results using the proposed method.
 
1. Speech emotion recognition using multilayer perceptron with CCC loss, dataset: IEMOCAP
2. Indonesian speech recognition using Wav2Vec2/Hubert/WavLM/UniSpeech-SAT, etc.
3. Toward universal acoustic features for multi-corpus speech emotion recognition, 30+ datasets.  
~~4. Predicting Alzheimer desease using speech analysis.~~
5. Development of Calfem-Python
6. Development of Vibration Toolbox  
~~7. Abnormal sound detection for predictive maitenance (the method is from you/your idea), dataset: DCASE~~
8. Indonesian emotional Speech synthesis Using FastSpeech  
~~9. COVID-19 diagnosis using COUGH sound with deep learning~~
10. COVID-19 diagnosis using SPEECH sound with deep learning, dataset: ComPare CSS 2021
11. Predicting Pathological voice disorder with speech processing technique, dataset: SVD, Voiced, HUPA

## Other topics/themes:  
Read my [papers](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=xuiLAewAAAAJ&hl=en). Usually, I wrote down the remaining tasks for future work in that topic. 
For master level, you can also propose your research theme. Contact me by email for details.

## Typical Timeline:  
![Timeline for undergraduate](images/pengerjaan-ta.png)

The timeline is ideal for undergraduate (S1), it can be adapted for master (S2) and PhD (three years of research from the beginning).
